# Motivation

Welcome to UUDI! We are really happy to know that you want to be part of our Dev Team and now, more than ever, you are really close to this. We just want to give you the opportunity to show us your skills through this task.

Almost everything that you need to know about this challenge is here for you the check, but always feel free to ask us if you have any remaning question.

So, now that you are ready. Let's get started.

# The Flutter Challenge

We have our partners need to manage their store's shopping cart and they want this solution to be a mobile app.

So, once we know how to create Flutter mobile apps, we just need to create it as the following:

- The first page of the app will present a list of products ( the data source is all up to you, can be a backend service or a local storage, you decide ).
  - Each product is a card, and the screen presentation for all the cards is also up to you to decide.
  - Each card has a add button and a remove button.
  - The page also haave a floating button representing the shopping cart with the number of products that are in the cart with no number being shown if the cart is empty
- When we touch the floating button we navigate to a new screen that show us all the items in the cart where each item is represented for the same card bellow
  - In the cart page we may have a button to empty the cart and be automatically redirected to the products page.

## Recommendations

You are free to use any technologies that you want to achieve the UI. Now the power to solve the partners' problem is on your hands!

You should use [git](https://git-scm.com/) to commit you development steps. If you don't have one, create a [Github](https://github.com/) account and publish you source code there as a public repository for the interviewer to have access to the code.

Use the README file to explain what you did and, as soon as it's done, send us an email with the repository name.

We are looking forward to see your code!
